# Social-Buzz-Data-Analysis

A project simulation for Accenture's client, Social Buzz, focused on analyzing and visualizing social media reaction data. This project showcases data modeling, cleaning, and visualization skills, and highlights top-performing content categories.

Project Overview
This project merges multiple data sets, calculates key metrics, and visualizes the top 5 content categories. The client, Social Buzz, aims to understand the performance of different content categories, trends in reaction types, and other insights to drive engagement strategies.

#Key Objectives
